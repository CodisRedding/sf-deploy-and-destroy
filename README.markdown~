# Deploy & Destroy #
	
This project is a module created to allow automatic destructive changes between your SFDC orgs. This module can be used within your deployment process to auto generate a destructiveChanges.xml file to include in your deployment package. If you use a source control system that allows branching you'll be able to branch without having to manually destroy components in the web UI that are not yet in a branch.  

see issues/milestones for dev tasks

# Example #

This [destructiveChanges.xml](https://gist.github.com/2572054) file is an example generated using deployAndDestroy. (Notice the picklistValues, they also include recordtype picklist values ;) )

*Note** this is just an example, so if you're wondering why there are standard objects, fields, etc. it's because I ran deployAndDestroy against an empty org.
