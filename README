	This project is a module created to allow automatic destructive changes between your SFDC 
orgs. This module can be used within your deployment process to auto generate a destructiveChanges.xml
file to include in your deployment package. If you use a source control system that allows 
branching you'll be able to branch without having to manually destroy components in the web UI 
that are not yet in a branch.
